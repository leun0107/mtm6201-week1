        Hi there! My name is Ayden, I am an international student from Hong Kong, who studied in Vancouver, B.C. for high school. I was born in Aug 27th, 2002. This is my first year in Ontario where I was supposed to enrolled in the Aviation program in the beginning of the last semester, though things changed and my passion in flying had faded. I never thought I would be studying in the design field, however so far the program is ethusiastic and I am thriving in it.

        The one thing I am most passionate about is Dancing. Ever since joining the dance club during high school. I fell in love with performing on stage where I am able to work with others to present a better performance. To me, it is so expressive and it requires no words. When I dance, I enjoy myself and try and get better every single time, losing myself in the music. I dance mostly to K-Pop, Jazzfunk, Hip-hop, and a little bit of Dancehall. I'm still practicing and trying to get better cause I'm still not that good yet. But it does help build my confidence and helped me a lot when I am stressed.
